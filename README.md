“Covid19 Pandemic genome sequence analysis and phylogenomics”

Aug 2, 2021 - Aug 13, 2021. **Online learning**

This Bioinformatic course will cover the analysis of Illumina PCR based whole viral genome sequence data from raw data to assembly and analysis. We’ll explore the assessment of sequence quality, PCR impact, and determinant of lineage (variant assignment). We’ll perform phylogenetic placement of samples into a greater context. The course will cover all the details from initial sample, library preparation and sequencing to end results and interpretation.

Prerequisites:
Familiarity with the linux command line and R, a general understanding of DNA Sequencing. Some time will be devoted to

Participants must have access to a computer with a reliable connection to the internet, current versions of [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed, and an application that allows them to ssh into a server (e.g. Bash for Windows, or Terminal for Apple).
