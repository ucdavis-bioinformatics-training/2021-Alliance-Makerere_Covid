## Structure of the Virtual Workshops

Given the current Covid19 pandemic, and stay in place orders around the world, we've decided to take our popular bioinformatic workshops virtual in 2020 and unfortunately also into 2021 now. We intend is to offer as close to an experience we can to our in-person workshops. We hold the same goals and strive for a similar lecture/hand-on ratio and will be using multiple technologies in order to help facilitate a maximum amount of interaction.

Course lecture, discussions, and one-on-one help/troubleshooting will be conducted using web materials, zoom recording and possible zoom meetings.

####  Slack

Text based communication will be conducted via a Slack channel. I will be monitoring the Slack channel to answer questions. If you know the answer to someone else's question, feel free to answer it.

#### Patience

We ask for a little more patience as this process, but I am committed to providing you the best educational experience I can.

### Workshop Goals

* End-to-End understanding of the basics of amplicon based Covid Whole Genome sequencing.

* To work through a complete set of Covid positive samples, starting from raw data to completion, including making figures.

### Workshop Materials

Workshop materials are all posted on github, and publicly available

### Computing Cluster

A portion of this course *may* be conducted on our servers and compute cluster. Instructions for getting (or resetting) an account will be sent in a follow up message.

If you already have, or have had in the past, an account on our systems, then please tell us your username, or email, and we will add you to the workshop. **Do not create a new account.**
